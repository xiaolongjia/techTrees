Just In Time simply refers to delivering parts or materials to manufacturers at or near the time they are needed for assembly. 
The primary goal of Just in Time is to produce goods with minimal waste including time, resources, 
and materials. Just In Time works to reduce inventory quantities or buffer inventory by providing manufacturers with components, 
and consumers with finished goods right when they need them. As a result, potential errors have greater consequences than traditional 
methods. Generally, the Just In time strategy is difficult to implement successfully but can result in significant efficiency improvements.


Just In Sequence also known as, In-Line Vehicle Sequencing(ILVS), 
or Sequential Parts Delivery(SPD) takes Just In Time strategies one step further by ensuring that parts are delivered at the scheduled time 
and in the exact order needed for assembly. For example. if an OEM was manufacturing side view mirrors and was planning on assembling these mirrors sequentially, 
they would communicate their sequenced demand to the supplier via ¡°a data interchange¡±. 
The supplier would then prepare loads of parts in sequential order according to the OEMs demand. 
These loads are also known as racks, pallets, or containers.
