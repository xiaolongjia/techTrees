Intermittent/Discrete Manufacturing

Discrete manufacturing is an industry term for the manufacturing of finished products 
that are distinct items capable of being easily counted, touched or seen. 

Discrete manufacturing involves parts and systems like nuts and bolts, brackets, wires, a
ssemblies and individual products.

Examples of products made from discrete manufacturing include automobiles, furniture, 
airplanes, toys, smartphones and defense systems. In theory, a discrete product can be broken down 
at the end of its lifecycle so its basic components can be recycled.

Discrete vs. process manufacturing£º

Discrete manufacturing contrasts with process manufacturing. 
In process manufacturing, the product is created by using a formula or recipe to refine raw ingredients 
and the final product cannot be broken down to its basic components.

Examples of goods produced by process manufacturing include pharmaceuticals, 
food and beverages, refined oil and paints.

Discrete manufacturers use a bill of materials (BOM) and production follows a route, 
such as an assembly line, whereas process manufacturing uses a recipe and the ingredients are blended or refined in batches.
