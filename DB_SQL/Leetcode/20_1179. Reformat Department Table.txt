1179. Reformat Department Table
https://leetcode.com/problems/reformat-department-table/

Table: Department

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| revenue       | int     |
| month         | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
(id, month) is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about the revenue of each department per month.
The month has values in ["Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"].

Write an SQL query to reformat the table such that there is a department id column and a revenue column for each month.

The query result format is in the following example:

Department table:
+------+---------+-------+
| id   | revenue | month |
+------+---------+-------+
| 1    | 8000    | Jan   |
| 2    | 9000    | Jan   |
| 3    | 10000   | Feb   |
| 1    | 7000    | Feb   |
| 1    | 6000    | Mar   |
+------+---------+-------+

Result table:
+------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+
| id   | Jan_Revenue | Feb_Revenue | Mar_Revenue | ... | Dec_Revenue |
+------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+
| 1    | 8000        | 7000        | 6000        | ... | null        |
| 2    | 9000        | null        | null        | ... | null        |
| 3    | null        | 10000       | null        | ... | null        |
+------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+

Note that the result table has 13 columns (1 for the department id + 12 for the months).


========================
schema:

Create table Department (id int, revenue int, month varchar(5))
Truncate table Department
insert into Department (id, revenue, month) values ('1', '8000', 'Jan')
insert into Department (id, revenue, month) values ('2', '9000', 'Jan')
insert into Department (id, revenue, month) values ('3', '10000', 'Feb')
insert into Department (id, revenue, month) values ('1', '7000', 'Feb')
insert into Department (id, revenue, month) values ('1', '6000', 'Mar')
insert into Department (id, revenue, month) values (1, 8000, 'May')

========================
solution:

select id, sum(case when month = 'Jan' then revenue else NULL end) as Jan_Revenue ,
           sum(case when month = 'Feb' then revenue else NULL end) as Feb_Revenue ,
           sum(case when month = 'Mar' then revenue else NULL end) as Mar_Revenue ,
           sum(case when month = 'Apr' then revenue else NULL end) as Apr_Revenue ,
           sum(case when month = 'May' then revenue else NULL end) as May_Revenue ,
           sum(case when month = 'Jun' then revenue else NULL end) as Jun_Revenue ,
           sum(case when month = 'Jul' then revenue else NULL end) as Jul_Revenue ,
           sum(case when month = 'Aug' then revenue else NULL end) as Aug_Revenue ,
           sum(case when month = 'Sep' then revenue else NULL end) as Sep_Revenue ,
           sum(case when month = 'Oct' then revenue else NULL end) as Oct_Revenue ,
           sum(case when month = 'Nov' then revenue else NULL end) as Nov_Revenue ,
           sum(case when month = 'Dec' then revenue else NULL end) as Dec_Revenue
