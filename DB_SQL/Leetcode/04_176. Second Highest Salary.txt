SQL Schema
Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. 
If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+

if not exists (select * from sysobjects where name='Employee' and xtype='U')
    create table Employee (
		Id int, 
		Salary int
    )
go


Truncate table Employee
insert into Employee (Id, Salary) values ('1', '100')
insert into Employee (Id, Salary) values ('2', '200')
insert into Employee (Id, Salary) values ('3', '300')


Solution:

select max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary  
from Employee 
where Salary not in (select top 1 Salary from Employee order by Salary DESC )
