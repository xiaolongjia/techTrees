Result table:
+-----------+
| fraction  |
+-----------+
| 0.33      |
+-----------+
Only the player with id 1 logged back in after the first day he had logged in 
so the answer is 1/3 = 0.33
```



主要思路是找出first day次日有登录记录的用户。

1. JOIN一个副表b对应次日，若为b为NULL则说明不符合
2. 用WHERE过滤出每个用户的 first day record

```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(
        COUNT(b.event_date)/ COUNT(a.player_id),
        2) fraction
FROM
    Activity a LEFT JOIN Activity b ON 
    b.player_id = a.player_id AND
    DATEDIFF(b.event_date,a.event_date) = 1 #b作a的次日
WHERE #first day
    (a.player_id,a.event_date) IN (SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date)
                                   FROM Activity
                                   GROUP BY player_id)
```
