For the player with id 1, 5 + 6 = 11 games played by 2016-05-02, and 5 + 6 + 1 = 12 games played by 2017-06-25.
For the player with id 3, 0 + 5 = 5 games played by 2018-07-03.
Note that for each player we only care about the days when the player logged in.

```sql
SELECT
    a.player_id,
    a.event_date,
    SUM(b.games_played) games_played_so_far
FROM
    Activity a LEFT JOIN Activity b ON 
    b.player_id = a.player_id AND
    b.event_date <= a.event_date  # 自连接 a对b 一对多
GROUP BY
    a.player_id,
    a.event_date
```

虽然是a **left** **join** b，由于是一对多所以最后records数还是超过了表a
