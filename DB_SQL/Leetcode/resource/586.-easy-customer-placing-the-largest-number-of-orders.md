考虑并列

```sql
SELECT customer_number
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_number
HAVING COUNT(1) = (SELECT COUNT(1)
                   FROM orders
                   GROUP BY customer_number
                   ORDER BY COUNT(1) DESC
                   LIMIT 1)
```

如果不需要考虑并列第一的情况

```sql
SELECT customer_number
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_number
ORDER BY COUNT(1) DESC
LIMIT 1

```
