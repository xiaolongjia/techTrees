Q #9) What are properties of the transaction?

Answer:

Properties of the transaction are known as ACID properties, such as

Atomicity: Ensures the completeness of all transactions performed. Checks whether every transaction is completed successfully if not then transaction is aborted at the failure point and the previous transaction is rolled back to its initial state as changes undone
Consistency: Ensures that all changes made through successful transaction are reflected properly on database
Isolation: Ensures that all transactions are performed independently and changes made by one transaction are not reflected on other
Durability: Ensures that the changes made in the database with committed transactions persist as it is even after a system failure
