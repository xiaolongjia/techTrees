=begin
A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. A pair of integers (P, Q), such that 0 ¡Ü P < Q < N, is called a slice of array A (notice that the slice contains at least two elements). The average of a slice (P, Q) is the sum of A[P] + A[P + 1] + ... + A[Q] divided by the length of the slice. To be precise, the average equals (A[P] + A[P + 1] + ... + A[Q]) / (Q ? P + 1).

For example, array A such that:

    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 2
    A[2] = 2
    A[3] = 5
    A[4] = 1
    A[5] = 5
    A[6] = 8
contains the following example slices:

slice (1, 2), whose average is (2 + 2) / 2 = 2;
slice (3, 4), whose average is (5 + 1) / 2 = 3;
slice (1, 4), whose average is (2 + 2 + 5 + 1) / 4 = 2.5.
The goal is to find the starting position of a slice whose average is minimal.

Write a function:

sub solution { my (@A)=@_; ... }

that, given a non-empty array A consisting of N integers, returns the starting position of the slice with the minimal average. If there is more than one slice with a minimal average, you should return the smallest starting position of such a slice.

For example, given array A such that:

    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 2
    A[2] = 2
    A[3] = 5
    A[4] = 1
    A[5] = 5
    A[6] = 8
the function should return 1, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [2..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [?10,000..10,000].
=cut

my @A = (4, 2, 2, 5, 1, 5, 8);
print(&solution(\@A));

sub solution {
	my ($A) = @_;
	my @A = @$A;
	my $position = 0;
	my $minAvg = 10000000000;

	for (my $i=0; $i<@A-1; $i++) {
		my $currAvg = (($A[$i]+$A[$i+1])/2);
		if ($currAvg < $minAvg) {
			$minAvg = $currAvg;
			$position = $i;
		}
	}
	return $position;
}
