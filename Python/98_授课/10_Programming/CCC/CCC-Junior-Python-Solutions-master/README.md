# CCC Junior
My Python solutions for Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) Junior Category, https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing.html

The problems and test data (input and output) can be found on the CEMC website: https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html

Another good website with an online judge and the CCC problems is DMOJ: https://dmoj.ca/problems/?category=4

While Python is a very popular language, most of the unofficial solutions for the CCC (that can be found on Github) are written in Java or C++, due to the benefit of speed. So, this repo is for my Python solutions of the CCC Junior problems that I have solved. I will update my solutions regularly and if my solutions can be improved, please let me know.
