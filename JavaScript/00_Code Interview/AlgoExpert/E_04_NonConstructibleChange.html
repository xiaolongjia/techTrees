<h3>
Given an array of positive intergers representing the values of coins in your possession,
write a function that returns the minimum amount of change (the minimum sum of money)
that you cannot create. The given coins can have any positive integer value 
and arenot necessarily unique (i.e., you can have multiple coins of the same value).

For example, if you are given coins = [1, 2, 5], the minimum amount of change 
that you cannot create is 4. If you are given no coins, the minimum amount of 
change that you cannot create is 1.

<script>
let coins =  [1, 1, 2, 4] ;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = nonConstructibleChange(coins);

function nonConstructibleChange(coins) {
	coins.sort((a, b) => a - b);
	let currChange = 0;
	for (const coin of coins) {
		if (coin > currChange + 1) {
			return currChange + 1
		}
		currChange += coin ;
	}
	return currChange+1;
