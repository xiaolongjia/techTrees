<h3>
It is photo day at the local school, and you are the photographer assigned to take class photos. <br>
The class that you will be photographing has an even number of students, <br>
and all these students are wearing red or blue shirts. In fact, exactly half of the <br>
class is wearing red shirts, and the other half is wearing blue shirts. <br>
You are responsible for arranging the students in two rows before taking <br>
the photo. Each row should contain the same number of the students and <br>
should adhere to the following guidelines:<br>
1. all students wearing red shirts must be in the same row. <br>
2. all students wearing blue shirts must be in the same row. <br>
3. each student in the back row must be strictly taller than the student directly in front of them in the front row <br>
<br>
you are given two input arrays: one containing the heights of all the students <br>
with red shirts and another one containing the heights of all the students with <br>
blue shirts. these arrays will always have the same length, and each height <br>
will be a positive integer. Write a function that returns whether or not <br>
a class photo that follows the stated guidelines can be taken. <br>

Sample input:
refShirtHeights =  [5,8,1,3,4]
blueShirtHeights = [6,9,2,4,5]

Sample output:
true

<script>
let redShirtHeights  =  [5,8,1,3,4];
let blueShirtHeights =  [6,9,2,4,5];

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = classPhotos(redShirtHeights, blueShirtHeights);

function classPhotos(redShirtHeights, blueShirtHeights) {
	redShirtHeights.sort();
	blueShirtHeights.sort();
	var front, back;
	if (redShirtHeights[0] > blueShirtHeights[0]) {
		back = redShirtHeights ;
		front = blueShirtHeights ; 
	} else {
		back = blueShirtHeights; 
		front = redShirtHeights;
	}
	
	for (let i=0; i<front.length; i++) {
		if (front[i] >= back[i]) {
			return false
		}
	}
	return true;
}
